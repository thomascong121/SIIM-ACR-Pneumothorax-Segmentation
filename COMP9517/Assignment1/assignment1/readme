1. how to run:
run code by typing (in terminal):
	 python3 assignment1_1_Test.py image path
need to set kernel size and threshold value manually in the "assignment1_1_Test.py" file.

2. how to select different filtering methods:
You can choose to run different filtering method by giving value to "GaussianBlur" or "median_blur", the value given to median_blur
will be the kernel size, and the value given to GaussianBlur should be a list, the first element in the list is the kernel size and the second and third
element are the derivation of x and y direction respectively.

3.main function
  - draw_plots(img,threshold_value,maxVal,adpt_mean=11,adpt_gaussian=11,C=2,median_blur=False,GaussianBlur=False)
  	has 6 parameters:
  	- img: input image path (necessary)
  	- threshold_value: threshold value for global thresholding algorithms (necessary)
  	- maxVal: the intensity value that will be set to when larger or smaller than the 	threshold_value (necessary)
  	- adpt_mean/adpt_gaussian: block size for adaptive thresholding (default value = 11)
  	- C: constant that need to be minus from mean (default value = 2)
  	- median_blur: median filtering will be applied if given a kernel size
  	- GaussianBlur: Gaussian filtering will be applied if given a kernel size
